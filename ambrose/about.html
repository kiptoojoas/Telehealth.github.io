    <p>Telehealth refers to the use of digital information and communication technologies, such as computers and mobile devices, to access and manage healthcare services remotely. It encompasses a wide range of services and technologies aimed at providing healthcare remotely, including:

        Telemedicine: Telemedicine involves the delivery of healthcare services, such as consultations, diagnoses, and treatment, using telecommunications technology. It allows patients to consult with healthcare providers remotely, often through video conferencing or phone calls.
        
        Remote Monitoring: Remote monitoring technologies allow healthcare providers to monitor patients' health status and vital signs from a distance. This can include devices that track blood pressure, heart rate, blood glucose levels, and more, transmitting data to healthcare providers in real-time.
        
        Mobile Health (mHealth): Mobile health technologies involve the use of mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to support healthcare delivery and patient engagement. This can include mobile apps for medication reminders, symptom tracking, virtual consultations, and accessing medical records.
        
        Digital Health Platforms: Digital health platforms provide a centralized system for managing healthcare services, patient data, and communication between patients and providers. These platforms may include electronic health records (EHRs), patient portals, telemedicine software, and other tools for healthcare delivery.
        
        Telehealth Education and Training: Telehealth also encompasses education and training initiatives for healthcare professionals to learn how to use telehealth technologies effectively. This can include online courses, webinars, and certification programs focused on telemedicine and digital health.
        
        Telehealth Policies and Regulations: Telehealth involves navigating a complex landscape of policies and regulations governing the delivery of remote healthcare services. This includes regulations related to patient privacy (e.g., HIPAA in the United States), licensure requirements for healthcare providers practicing across state or national borders, reimbursement policies for telehealth services, and more.
        
        Telehealth Integration with Healthcare Systems: Many healthcare organizations are integrating telehealth services into their existing healthcare systems to expand access to care, improve efficiency, and enhance patient outcomes. This may involve integrating telehealth platforms with electronic health records (EHRs), scheduling systems, and other healthcare IT infrastructure.</p>
